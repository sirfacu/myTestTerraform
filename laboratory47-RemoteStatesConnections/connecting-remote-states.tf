/*
* The idea to use remote states basically is let to our code fetch 
* the output values from another projects and use as input for our project
* ex. project A have configured ips as outputs and project B needs create a 
* white list with the outputs from project A
* 
* To achieve our goal we need configure a file to declare a new datasource
* from project B pointing to Project A
* Inside there we configure all information related to de backend where the 
* output take place
* 
* Inside our project A that is (what|which) export the values input for our 
* destination project we need just create the output
