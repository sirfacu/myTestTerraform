/* Sometimes we going to face up the challenge where within the company
* don't use a IaC tool and all infrastructure has been created manually
* so we need to improve this and bring into a IaC tool as terraform in this case
* well terraform have the command import, (usage: terraform import) that let us
* to manage the resources that was created manually for this we need to create
* manually the resources and terraform will take care of populate the tfstate file.
*
* In this study case, I previously created manually a s3 buscket called  <terraform-import-buc>
* and an EC2 instance called terraformImport and the idea is try out to import to our
* project and manage from terraform instead of manually.
*
* we need to define the resources we want to populate and the id specific of the resource 
* where the configuration should be read
*
* Ex. I create the resource aws_instance with name myImportEC2 and the instance have the 
* id i-0ad3fa70fb92529dc
*
* So I need to run the command in this way:
* <terraform import aws_instance.myImportEC2 i-0ad3fa70fb92529dc>
*
* Is important to understand that terraform import just is a useful command to fullfill the
* tfstate file, it doesn't load configuration we hope in a future version TF let populate 
* the configura too
